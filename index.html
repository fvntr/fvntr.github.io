        <p>Hi! I'm Felipe Ventura. My background is in community organizing and software engineering. I believe in the transformative power of community networks on an individual and societal level. The focus of my work is building and scaling these networks.</p>

        <p>Mapping how information flows across community networks is as fascinating as how its members learn to share their visions of whatâ€™s possible, become agents of change, and make meaningful commitments to work with others. This space is an ongoing exploration of this labor on a number of fronts.</p>
